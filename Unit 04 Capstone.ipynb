I tried stopping the pills and restarting to get the period at the right time but nope it stayed in the middle. I do have to say it was really really light and maybe two days max. No cramping whatsoever. I was such a happy camper bc without bc I'd feel like I was gonna pass out from the pain. So after a year or so my periods completely stopped.

My girlfriend and I had sex while she was ovulating and the condom broke and I came completely inside her. We got plan B about 45 minutes later, and obviously we were both freaking out because we're still youngish. I felt like the odds were against us, because we both had teen parents so I was guessing we were both pretty fertile. But, she got her period today (6 days later). It was lighter than normal and early but I know those are both symptoms of plan B. This pill is 95% effective so stop worrying, you aren't pregnant :)\"</th>\n",
